## Our goals:   
Understand and develop a client's emerging idea so that she has a support to present her project later and test it.   
     
In this case, a website of a music press agency presenting some articles to stir curiosity - like blog - with a member access to offer personalized services paid.   
     
We chose to use wordpress so that the customer can feed her website alone afterwards because she don't have any knowledge about web development. We had a week to understand the expectations of the client and define the project and a week to apprehend WordPress and develop the website.     
      
It's a 100% free WordPress project.
